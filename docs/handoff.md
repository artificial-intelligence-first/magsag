# Handoff Guide (Archived)

> The Python handoff flow was removed. TypeScript replacements are still in design.

- Capture handoff requirements under `docs/development/plans/repo-cleanup-execplan.md` before implementation work starts.
- Record manual fallbacks in delivery notes when agents require human review or escalation.
- Update this page only after the TypeScript handoff surfaces land and validation commands are defined.

## Update Log

- 2025-11-04: Replaced the deprecated Python handoff walkthrough with an archived placeholder.
