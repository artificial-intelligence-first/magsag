# MAGSAG Framework Hardening ExecPlan

> **For Humans**: Maintain this plan as the canonical tracker for governance and release hardening work.
>
> **For AI Agents**: Update timestamps, decisions, and to-do items as you execute tasks. Keep the plan synced with related documentation.

Refer to the template in `docs/development/PLANS.md` for structure and usage expectations. This ExecPlan is living—keep Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes current as work proceeds.

## Purpose / Big Picture
Anchor the MAGSAG repository around a resilient, AI-first walking skeleton so subsequent feature work inherits proven governance, observability, and packaging practices from day one.

## To-do
### Governance and Policy
- [ ] Document the upgrade path for alternative runner adapters (Temporal, LangGraph, bespoke adapters) so governance gates remain compatible.
- [ ] Expand policy coverage to include skill manifest validation and security posture checks before scaling the agent catalog.

### Release and Operations
- [ ] Establish a documented release cadence for mirrored Flow Runner assets and JSON Schemas, including automation hooks.
- [ ] Publish contributor-facing runbooks for syncing Flow Runner sample assets when upstream tags change.

### Documentation Hygiene
- [ ] Cross-link ExecPlan expectations from `README.md`, [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md), and contributor docs.
- [ ] Capture validation guidance in `CHANGELOG.md` and [SSOT.md](../../SSOT.md) as features graduate from this plan.

## Progress
- [2025-11-02 12:15 UTC] Published documentation workflows and templates; notified contributors to trial them on upcoming releases and ExecPlans.
- [2025-11-02 09:30 UTC] Phase 3 MCP integration delivered: catalog skills invoke governed MCP servers exclusively, FastMCP server proxies real AgentRunner/SkillRuntime calls, policies/docs/tests aligned.
- [2025-10-23 02:30 UTC] Hardened typing and fixtures across runners, registry, governance gate, and API tests; added stub packages so `mypy --strict` succeeds alongside pytest/ruff checks.
- [2025-10-21 07:40 UTC] Refactored ExecPlan to the ExecPlans template, migrated historical accomplishments, and identified remaining governance hardening tasks.
- [2025-10-20 15:30 UTC] Walking skeleton validated end-to-end (registry lookup → schema validation → Flow Runner invocation) with automation tests and documentation updates.
- [2025-10-20 13:45 UTC] Flow Runner adapter, CLI entry points, and mirrored assets integrated with packaging configuration and smoke-test guidance.
- [2025-10-20 11:55 UTC] Governance gate operationalized via `magsag flow gate` (TypeScript CLI), wired into CI alongside Flow Runner validation and Multi-Agent Governance checks.
- [2025-10-20 11:10 UTC] Observability summary tooling created for Flow Runner `.runs/`, exposing per-step metrics and MCP call counts.
- [2025-10-20 10:40 UTC] Baseline repository skeleton established with `uv` tooling, initial directories, and core documentation.

## Update Log

- 2025-11-02: Refreshed metadata and aligned tags with the documentation taxonomy.
- 2025-11-01: Converted to the unified documentation format and refreshed references.
- 2025-10-24: Added SSOT planning reference and initial hardening scope.

## Surprises & Discoveries
- [2025-10-20 16:05 UTC] Packaging smoke tests revealed missing mirrored assets; resolved by extending `uv build` guidance and ensuring wheel includes Flow Runner fixtures.

## Decision Log
- [2025-10-20 12:15 UTC] Prioritized delivering an AI & AI Agent-first walking skeleton before expanding feature depth to guarantee future agents inherit validated governance flows.

## Outcomes & Retrospective
Framework deliverables are in place with passing tests and policy checks, ready for iterative enhancements to governance coverage and release operations.

## Context and Orientation
- Repository: `magsag` (feature lineage: `feat/bootstrap-magsag`).
- Core directories: `src/magsag/`, `catalog/`, `ops/`, `docs/`.
- Supporting documentation: `docs/guides/agent-development.md`, `README.md`, `SSOT.md`, `docs/development/changelog.md`.

## Plan of Work
1. **Stabilize Governance Spine** – Formalize adapter upgrade guidance and extend policy coverage.
2. **Operationalize Release Cadence** – Define and automate Flow Runner asset/schema sync workflows.
3. **Harden Documentation Loop** – Ensure ExecPlan practices feed back into contributor onboarding materials.

## Concrete Steps
1. Draft adapter upgrade guide covering Temporal and LangGraph prototypes; store under `docs/` with cross-references from `docs/guides/agent-development.md`.
2. Flow Runner setup is now automated via `ops/scripts/setup-flowrunner.sh` (run with `make setup-flowrunner`).
3. Extend policy validation scripts to lint skill manifests and enforce security posture; add pytest coverage in `tests/governance/`.
4. Update contributor documentation to reference ExecPlan lifecycle and validation expectations.

## Validation and Acceptance
- [ ] `pnpm -r lint`
- [ ] `pnpm -r typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm -r test`
- [ ] `pnpm docs:lint`
- [ ] `pnpm catalog:validate`
- [ ] `pnpm ci:e2e`
- [ ] `pnpm ci:size`
- [ ] `echo '{"role":"Engineer","level":"Mid"}' | pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag agent run offer-orchestrator-mag`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag flow available`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag flow summarize --output /tmp/summary.json`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag flow gate /tmp/summary.json`

## Idempotence and Recovery
- Flow Runner asset sync scripts must be rerunnable; guard file operations with existence checks.
- Governance policy updates should include rollback instructions (`git checkout -- catalog/policies/flow_governance.yaml`).
- Maintain disposable virtual environments for packaging smoke tests to avoid contaminating the primary dev environment.

## Artifacts and Notes
- Policy definitions: `catalog/policies/flow_governance.yaml`.
- Governance tooling: `packages/observability/src/flow-summary.ts`, CLI command `pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag flow gate`.
- Runner scripts: `ops/scripts/setup-flowrunner.sh` (generates `ops/scripts/flowrunner-env.sh`).
- Agent templates: `catalog/agents/_template/mag-template/` and `catalog/agents/_template/sag-template/`.
- Development automation: `Makefile` with common tasks.
- Historical progress captured in this ExecPlan; future PRs must reference relevant sections.

## Interfaces and Dependencies
- Flow Runner CLI (`magsag.cli.flow`) for workflow execution.
- Agent Runner (`magsag.runners.agent_runner`) for MAG/SAG orchestration.
- Agent registry (`catalog/registry/agents.yaml`) and skill registry (`catalog/registry/skills.yaml`).
- Agent descriptors in `catalog/agents/{main,sub}/<agent-slug>/agent.yaml`.
- JSON Schema contracts in `catalog/contracts/` consumed by agents and skills.
- CI workflows executing governance checks and packaging validation.
