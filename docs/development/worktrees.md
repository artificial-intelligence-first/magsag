# Git Worktree Operations

> **For Humans**: Use these commands and policies to manage per-run worktrees safely.
>
> **For AI Agents**: Follow this flow when scripting worktree operations. Do not bypass safety guards unless instructed.

MAGSAG provisions one Git worktree per agent run to isolate file changes and reduce merge conflicts. The implementation introduced in `feat/git-worktree` surfaces consistent tooling across the CLI, API, and observability stack.

## Directory Layout

- Worktrees live outside the main checkout at `../.worktrees/` (override with `MAGSAG_WORKTREES_ROOT`).
- Each tree is created inside `wt-<runId>-<task>-<shortSHA>` and checks out branch `wt/<runId>/<task>` unless `--detach` is used.
- The metadata file `.magsag-worktree.json` persists run metadata and is removed automatically during `git worktree remove`.

## Environment Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAGSAG_WORKTREES_ROOT` | `../.worktrees` | Location where managed worktrees are created. |
| `MAGSAG_WT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Maximum number of active managed worktrees. |
| `MAGSAG_WT_TTL` | `14d` | Default expiry horizon passed to `git worktree prune`. |
| `MAGSAG_WT_ALLOW_FORCE` | unset | Set to `1`/`true` in CI maintenance jobs to allow forced removals. |

Protected bases (`main`, `release/*`) and `--force` removals are guarded by policy.

## CLI Usage

```
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt new <runId> --task <slug> --base <branch|sha> [--detach] [--no-checkout] [--lock] [--lock-reason]
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt ls [--json]
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt rm <runId> [--force]
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt lock <runId> [--reason]
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt unlock <runId>
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt gc [--expire <duration>]
pnpm --filter @magsag/cli exec magsag wt repair
```

The CLI surfaces structured errors for conflicts, dirty trees, or policy violations.
`magsag wt rm` automatically runs `git worktree prune --expire=<MAGSAG_WT_TTL>` to garbage-collect
stale administrative entries after a successful removal.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description | Scopes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/worktrees` | List managed worktrees. | `worktrees:read` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/worktrees` | Create a worktree (`lock`, `lock_reason`, `detach`, `no_checkout`). | `worktrees:write` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/worktrees/{id}` | Remove by run ID or directory name (`force` query flag). | `worktrees:write` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/worktrees/{id}/lock` | Lock the worktree. | `worktrees:lock` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/worktrees/{id}/unlock` | Unlock the worktree. | `worktrees:unlock` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/worktrees/gc` | Run `git worktree prune`. | `worktrees:maintain` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/worktrees/repair` | Run `git worktree repair`. | `worktrees:maintain` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/worktrees/events` | Server-sent events (`worktree.create/remove/lock/unlock/prune/repair`). | `worktrees:read` |

Responses are serialized with `WorktreeResponse`, exposing run metadata, lock state, prunable flags, and timestamps.

## Observability

Operations emit OpenTelemetry spans (`git.worktree.add`, `git.worktree.list`, `git.worktree.remove`, `git.worktree.prune`, `git.worktree.lock`, `git.worktree.unlock`, `git.worktree.repair`) and Langfuse metrics when enabled:

- Histogram `worktree_create_duration_ms`
- Histogram `worktree_remove_duration_ms`
- UpDownCounter `worktrees_active`

Events flow through an in-process bus; subscribers register via `get_event_bus().register()` and receive `WorktreeEvent` items published by the manager and CLI/API surfaces.

## Testing Notes

Unit tests validate porcelain parsing, branch naming guards, and cleanup behaviour. Integration tests exercise `WorktreeManager` end-to-end using a temporary repository, including event emission, locking, and removal.

## Update Log

- 2025-11-02: Refreshed metadata and aligned tags with the documentation taxonomy.
- 2025-11-01: Added frontmatter and audience guidance for the unified documentation standard.
