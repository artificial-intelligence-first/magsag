# Changelog

> **For Humans**: Track noteworthy MAGSAG changes here. Every entry explains user-facing impact, links to issues or docs, and follows SemVer semantics.
>
> **For AI Agents**: Update the `Unreleased` section whenever you ship a meaningful behaviour change. Do not create tagged releases without human approval.

## Overview

- Format: [Keep a Changelog][keepachangelog]
- Versioning: [Semantic Versioning][semver]
- Scope: CLI, API, runners, catalog assets, docs, and governance updates that affect project users.

[semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

## How to Use This File

1. Append user-facing updates under `## [Unreleased]` with the correct category (`Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`).
2. When preparing a release, move curated entries into a new version section with an ISO 8601 date.
3. Update comparison links at the end of the file to keep GitHub diff references accurate.

## Release Notes

### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- External handoff pipeline linking OpenAI Agents SDK to Claude Agent SDK and Codex drivers via `ExternalHandoffTool`, `POST /api/v1/agents/handoff`, and `magsag agent handoff`.
- Google ADK sync workflow (`magsag mcp sync`) rendering `.mcp/servers/<provider>.json` and `catalog/tools/<provider>/*.json` from `ops/adk/catalog.yaml` + `ops/adk/servers/*.yaml`.
- BudgetController for provider spend limits with environment-driven configuration and integration into external handoffs.
- Traceparent helper (`observability.tracing.current_traceparent`) for downstream integrations needing explicit context strings.
- Durable runner snapshot store now auto-creates run metadata, persists snapshots to configured storage backends, and emits `run.snapshot.saved` / `run.resume` events.
- Async MCP client and decorators gained full JSON-RPC transport support (stdio/websocket/http), approval-gated invocation flow, and dedicated unit coverage.
- Handoff tool now records `handoff.requested` / `handoff.completed` events via the storage backend with regression tests covering the event path.
- MCP governance now includes explicit `fetch` server policies and approval prompts for remote web fetch operations.
- Standard MCP presets (Notion, Supabase, GitHub, Obsidian) with Typer CLI helpers, bundled YAML assets, and sample skills for each provider.
- MCP observability ledger (`mcp_calls.jsonl`) and OTel span attributes capturing transport, session ID, protocol version, and policy outcomes.

#### Changed
- PlanIR expanded to capture versioning, capability requirements, budgets, and audit metadata; AgentRunner now resolves external targets and enforces approvals/budgets before delegation.
- External handoff CLI/API resolve targets automatically when `--target auto` or capability hints are supplied, and the runtime ensures Claude/Codex dispatchers are always registered.
- Claude and Codex drivers register with the external dispatcher registry, apply sandbox enforcement, and propagate trace context for Langfuse/OTel correlation.
- AgentRunner automatically captures session `input`/`output` memories when memory IR is enabled and routes MAGSAG handoffs through the configured runner payload.
- Catalog skills (`doc-gen`, `salary-band-lookup`, `example-web-search`) now require the configured MCP runtime, query governed data sources, and surface errors when MCP is unavailable; associated docs, YAML policies, and tests were updated.
- FastMCP server integration executes real skills via `AgentRunner`/`SkillRuntime`, replacing the Phase 2 placeholder response pipeline.
- MCP runtime prioritises HTTP → SSE → stdio fallback, enforces agent-level tool policies, and masks arguments before logging observability records.
- Documentation workflows, templates, and tag taxonomy were consolidated (`docs/workflows/*`, `docs/_templates/*`, `docs/governance/taxonomy.md`) with cross-references added across AGENTS/SSOT/CONTRIBUTING.
- MCP integration guide and `.mcp/README` were refreshed for HTTP-first presets, Typer CLI tooling, and provider-specific authentication guidance.
- Fetch sample server now uses `@pulsemcp/pulse-fetch`, and the legacy git preset was removed from `.mcp/servers/` to avoid broken npx installs.

#### Fixed
- `AgentRunner.delegate_external()` now raises a clear error when invoked inside a running event loop, preventing illegal loop reuse.
- External handoff budget enforcement accepts zero-cent limits, ensuring budget guards trigger even for no-spend delegations.
- Approval gating for external handoffs normalizes risk tags, so mixed-case values still require review.
- `observability.tracing.current_traceparent()` and `sdks.base.build_trace_context()` no longer treat `is_valid` as callable, avoiding runtime errors when spans are active.
- Planner lazily imports `PlanIR`/`PlanStep` at runtime so `Planner.plan()` returns a valid PlanIR instead of raising `TypeError`.

### [0.1.0] - 2025-10-30

#### Added
- Initial public release of the MAGSAG framework with Typer CLI (`magsag`) covering flow, agent, data, and MCP commands.
- FastAPI HTTP API with custom error formatting, rate limiting hooks, and `/health` endpoint.

- Observability stack including JSONL + SQLite cost tracking, OpenTelemetry bootstrap, and run summarisation.

#### Changed
- Standardised repository documentation to align with SSOT templates (AGENTS, CONTRIBUTING, PLANS, README, SKILL, SSOT).

## Maintenance Notes

- Always include links to relevant issues/PRs where possible, e.g. `(#123)`.
- Document schema or policy changes that require downstream updates (docs, contracts, infrastructure).
- If a change is purely internal, mention it under `Changed` only when it affects contributor workflows.
