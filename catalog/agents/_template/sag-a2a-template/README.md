# SAG A2A Template (TypeScript Migration)

Use the TypeScript agent templates for cross-agent communication. The Python samples (`code/advisor.py`) and pytest helpers were removed.

- Export your SAG from a TypeScript package (`@magsag/catalog#agents.yourA2aAdvisorSag`).
- Update catalog metadata and validation notes accordingly.
